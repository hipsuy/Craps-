Hello there, fella!

This game's code is almost completely lifted from the book "Learning C", by Graham(though the wannabe Shakespeare that I am, my amateur influence reflects in the language of the statements printed in the game).

The objective for me was to try and compile the game myself while understanding the nuiances of C and programming in general, and it was indeed quite an experience!

The files have some really beautiful lines of code( according to me) and I thought about sharing this joy with the world.

So, all the credit to Mr. Graham, a relatively unknown author whose book, "Learning C" was an absolute joy to read!

Have a good day!
